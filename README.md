# Machine Learning 382 - GroupF - Streamlining BC Financeâ€™s Home Loan Eligibility Process

BC Finance Company provides financial services across all home loan categories. Offering services to clients in urban, semi-urban, and rural areas, the organization has many facets. The organization currently uses an ineffective manual procedure to validate customers' eligibility. The procedure entails the client submitting an application for a home loan by answering questions and supplying personal information. These responses must then go through a lengthy validation process and this can be a problem for handling multiple applications leading to decreased customer satisfaction, manual errors and lengthy application times which could lead to customers seeking other financial institutes to provide financial services for their needs.

The organization is working to create an automated system that can accurately determine a customer's eligibility for a home loan in real time in order to address this problem. To ascertain if a customer is eligible for a loan, this system will examine a number of customer variables, including gender, marital status, education, number of dependents, income, loan amount, credit history, and others.

The principal aim is to divide clients into discrete categories according to their loan quantum eligibility. By doing this, BC Finance hopes to more successfully target these consumer segments and provide them with loan products and services that are customized to their unique requirements and preferences. BC Finance hopes to improve client happiness, reduce manual errors, and streamline its lending procedures for long-term profitability and growth by putting in place an automated loan qualifying system.
